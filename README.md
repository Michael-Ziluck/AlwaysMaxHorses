# Always Max Horses
This is a very simple mod fully compatible with vanilla Minecraft that makes horses always have max stats *once you
mount them*. It does not apply until after you mount them, and it applies globally to every horse.

This affects the following entity types:
- Horse
- Zombie Horse
- Skeleton Horse
